I am starting a mini project of giving an effective hand motion detection. 
This tips can capture your audience's interest and help focus on what I am going to share. 



# Until now the game is standed by just two players.

1/ Once the camera detects two hands, the party starts, each player could gains score with touching the ball with his index finger.

2/ If a given player touch three balls with the same color successively, his score will be multiplied x3.

3/ So to prevent this from happening, we could just touch the ball with the middle finger, then no score is gained for both player.
